# `libvlc` for .NET

[![Join the chat at https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF](https://img.shields.io/discord/716939396464508958?label=discord)](https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF)

This repository is about presenting `libvlc` and its capabilities to .NET developers.
It also contains packaging tools and files for nuget packaging/deployment.
In other words: It's just the same thing as if you had downloaded the files from VideoLAN's website, in a NuGet package,
that you can add in your .NET project so that it gets copied into the output directory.

# What is libvlc?

`libvlc` is the multimedia framework powering the VLC applications. It is fully opensource, so other apps use it too.

**API documentation**: https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc.html

it contains all modules, data structures and functions documentation to understand how to use the `libvlc` C API.

The **source** is in the main VLC repository: https://github.com/videolan/vlc

`libvlc` is *modularized* into hundreds of plugins, which may be loaded at runtime. This architecture provides great flexibility to developers (both VLC devs and devs consuming the library). The unified, complete and (somewhat) high level `libvlc` C API allows a wide range of operations, such as:
- Play every media file formats, every codec and every streaming protocols
- Run on every platform, from desktop (Windows, Linux, Mac) to mobile (Android, iOS) and TVs
- Hardware and efficient decoding on every platform, up to 8K
- Network browsing for distant filesystems (SMB, FTP, SFTP, NFS...) and servers (UPnP, DLNA)
- Playback of Audio CD, DVD and Bluray with menu navigation
- Support for HDR, including tonemapping for SDR streams
- Audio passthrough with SPDIF and HDMI, including for Audio HD codecs, like DD+, TrueHD or DTS-HD
- Support for video and audio filters
- Support for 360 video and 3D audio playback, including Ambisonics
- Able to cast and stream to distant renderers, like Chromecast and UPnP renderers.

Full list of the new 3.0 features can be found here: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/releases/3.0.0.html

Full directory tree overview of what's included (dlls, headers, lib files) in the nuget can be found at https://github.com/mfkl/libvlc-nuget/blob/master/tree.md

# How do I use this thing from .NET?

There are usually 2 ways to go about consuming C code from .NET:
- Using [C++/CX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cppcx/visual-c-language-reference-c-cx). This allows to author [Windows Runtime components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/windows-runtime-cpp-template-library-wrl) and it is Windows-specific. [VLC for UWP](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt) currrently works this way using both [libvlcppcx](https://github.com/kakone/libVLCX) and [libvlcpp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlcpp).
- Using [P/Invoke](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/). If crossplatform is a focus, you should checkout [LibVLCSharp](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp).

Versioning of the nuget packages naturally follow the libvlc versioning.

# Build and packaging customization with MSBuild

How do I configure what gets copied to my output directory?

Currently, you can customize three things during the build:

- [Whether the library gets copied or not](library-copy-enabling.md)
- [Where the library is placed in the output folder](files-location-selection.md)
- [Which files are copied](cherry-picking.md)

# Supported platforms

#### LibVLC 3:

Latest stable version is [3.0.21](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/tags). Feel free to check out the [release notes](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/blob/3.0.x/NEWS).

- Android 2.3

## Windows Classic

```cmd
 dotnet add package VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows
```

*For the GPL version, use the following command:*
```cmd
 dotnet add package VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows.GPL
```
